## Confirm appointment package

This package gives a patient an appointment date and time and asks them to confirm or cancel the appointment.

The package takes three inputs: YES, NO, or STOP (to stop receiving appointment reminders).

The appointment time currently is randomly generated for this year between 9-5. 

In the future it might get input from doctor's office for patient appoitnment information, and then based on patient identity query their phone number to send them this reminder.
