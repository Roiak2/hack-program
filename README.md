# hack-program

an example Python CLI program

## Confirm appointment package

This package gives a patient an appointment date and time and asks them to confirm or cancel the appointment.

The package takes three inputs: YES, NO, or STOP (to stop receiving appointment reminders).

The appointment time currently is randomly generated for this year between 9-5. 

In the future it might get input from doctor's office for patient appoitnment information, and then based on patient identity query their phone number to send them this reminder.

The program also randomly samples from a database of inspirational quotes.
If the patient confirms an appointment, they will receive an inspirational quote.
